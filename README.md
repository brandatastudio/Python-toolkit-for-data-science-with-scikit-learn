# Python-toolkit-for-data-science-with-scikit-learn
A list of files with functions ( both commonly used  in the datascience community, or created by me personally) used for data science and machine learning. We use for model experimentation the scikit-learn library.
The files are ordered as steps, in a data scientist's workflow. Starting with data loading/creation, cleaning, transformation and engineering
following by analysis and model experimentation,concluding with model scoring and testing. 


The list of libraries, and their respective versions used at the moment of this repository creation, are the following:
Python     3.6.5 
sklearn    0.19.1
matplotlib 2.2.2
