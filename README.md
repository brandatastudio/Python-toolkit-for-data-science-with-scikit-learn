# Python-toolkit-for-data-science-with-scikit-learn
A list of files with functions ( both commonly used  in the datascience community, or created by me personally) used for data science and machine learning. We use for model experimentation the scikit-learn library.
The files are ordered as steps, in a data scientist's workflow. Starting with data loading/creation, cleaning, transformation and engineering
following by analysis and model experimentation,concluding with model scoring and testing.
